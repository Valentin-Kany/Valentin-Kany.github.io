I am a PhD student in the [Phonetics group](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/BM/phonetics/){:target="_blank"} and in the group for [German as a foreign/second language](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/haberzettl.html){:target="_blank"} at Saarland University.
I am part of the ["Wuschel-Project"](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/haberzettl/projekte/sprachliche-bildung-in-kita.html){:target="_blank"} which focuses on the semiautomatic assessment of language proficiency of preschool children.

My research interests include 
* Disfluencies in speech
* Speech and Language Technologies in Education
* Dialectal variation
* Sound symbolism
